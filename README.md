## GRIPNOV21 Task3 - Payment Gateway Integration
◇ Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.  
◇ There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.   
◇ Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.  
◇ On any page / email, only basic information is needed.   
◇ Create your own temporary / sandbox / testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations.   
◇ Host the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free hosting provider. Check in code in gitlab.  

## Uplifters
Participate. Rehabilitate.

We aim to uplift India by rehabilitating beggars by providing Food, Counselling, Make-Over & Employment.

Our teams approach the beggars by first offering food and eventually know their problems and offer a solution to it. The transformation is done from the place where the beggars reside and after make-over is done, depending on beggars’ wish, they are either moved to a shelter home or a hospital.

“There is no force used. Our motive is to make them presentable so that they get jobs as waiters in cafes or as daily-wage labourers.”
